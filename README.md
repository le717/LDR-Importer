# LDR Importer #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/le717/LDR-Importer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/le717/LDR-Importer)

A [Blender 3D](http://www.blender.org) Importer script for the [LDraw Parts Library](http://www.ldraw.org).

> LDraw&trade; is an open standard for LEGO CAD programs that allow the user to create virtual LEGO models and scenes. You can use it to document models
you have physically built, create building instructions just like LEGO, render 3D photo realistic images of your virtual models and even make animations.
The possibilities are endless. Unlike real LEGO bricks where you are limited by the number of parts and colors, in LDraw nothing is impossible.

# Purpose #

The purpose of the **LDR Importer** is to import LDraw and LDraw compatible parts and models into Blender as they should be (including proper mesh and materials). However, options to improve the import, such as cleaning up said mesh and other features, are available at the user's disposal. Other options, such as photo-realism, are left to the user to perform.

# Releases #

All releases from version v1.0 onward are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/le717/LDR-Importer/releases) page.
All previous releases are available on le717's personal 
[SourceForge.net account](http://sourceforge.net/projects/le717.u/files/Blender/Blender%202.6%20LDraw%20Importer/). It is always recommended to use the newest release unless otherwise noted.
